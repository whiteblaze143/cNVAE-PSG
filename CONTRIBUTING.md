## üìã Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Academic Affiliation**: Contributors should be affiliated with academic or research institutions
2. **Data Access**: If working with data, ensure you have proper authorization through Health Data Nexus
3. **Research Ethics**: Understand and comply with research ethics requirements (REB #6197)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cNVAE-PSG.git
   cd cNVAE-PSG
   ```

2. **Create development environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. **Install pre-commit hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/description` - New features or enhancements
- `bugfix/description` - Bug fixes
- `experiment/description` - Experimental changes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation if needed

- Bullet points for multiple changes
- Reference issues with #issue-number
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples**:
```bash
feat(model): add attention mechanism to cNVAE decoder
fix(data): resolve EDF loading memory leak  
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## üß™ Code Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use Black for code formatting: `black .`
- Use flake8 for linting: `flake8 src/`
- Type hints for function signatures: `mypy src/`

### Documentation Standards
- Docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include parameter types and return values
- Provide usage examples for complex functions

**Example**:
```python
def preprocess_edf_signals(
    edf_path: Path, 
    target_fs: int = 250,
    filter_params: Optional[Dict] = None
) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Dict]:
    """Preprocess EDF signals for model training.
    
    Args:
        edf_path: Path to the EDF file
        target_fs: Target sampling frequency in Hz
        filter_params: Optional filtering parameters
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of preprocessed signals and metadata
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If EDF file doesn't exist
        ValueError: If target_fs is invalid
        
    Example:
        >>> signals, meta = preprocess_edf_signals(
        ...     Path("data/patient001.edf"), 
        ...     target_fs=250
        ... )
    """
```

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use pytest for testing framework
- Mock external dependencies (file I/O, network calls)

**Run tests**:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/
```

## üîí Data and Privacy Guidelines

### Data Handling
- **Never commit sensitive data** to the repository
- Use mock/synthetic data for tests and examples
- Respect the Health Data Nexus Data Use Agreement
- Follow de-identification best practices

### File Restrictions
The following should never be committed:
- `.edf` files (EDF signal data)
- `.csv` files with patient data
- Personal health information (PHI)
- API keys or credentials

## üìù Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Run all checks**:
   ```bash
   black src/ tests/
   flake8 src/ tests/
   mypy src/
   pytest tests/
   ```

2. **Update documentation** if needed
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
